  // Options needed to parse locally
  "eiPath": "",

  // Options needed to interact with dps.report
  "dpsReportToken": "",

}
```

#### Local parsing with Elite Insights

* `eiPath`: the path to the Elite Insights `.exe` file
* `configurationPath`: the path to the configuration file Elite Insights uses to store your settings

By using the local parsing the folder which is used by arcdps to save the logs and the folder that Elite 
Insights uses to store the html files is taken from the Elite Insights configuration.

#### dps.report settings

* `dpsReportToken`: the user token you have for dps.report. You can find out yours by opening https://dps.report/getUserToken
* `outputPath`: the path that you want the html timeline file to be saved to. Only needed when you do not use Elite Insights.
* `logPath`: the path where arcdps saves the log files. Normally something like `C:\Users\<user>\Dokumente\Guild Wars 2\addons\arcdps\arcdps.cbtlogs`. Only needed when you do not use Elite Insights.

#### Encounter filter

* `bossEncounterIdFilter`: the hexadecimal values of enemies you want to filter for. The default value is all raid bosses. A list of ids can be found on the GW2 wiki: https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Jowjowjow/npcids

#### Generic upload

* `endpointUri`: the uir that is used for uploading html files.
* `endpointKey`: key of the RijndaelManaged encryption in Base64.
* `endpointIv`: key of the RijndaelManaged encryption in Base64.

### Some information

#### How is the timeline created

The timeline takes the created Elite Insight HTML files and creates an overview page where you can:

* See how long your raids (ordered by days) took and how long you where in and out of combat
* See how many bosses you tried / killed / failed
* See the order of your tries and their status
* See the top dps, rez, mechanic fails and the boon uptime
* Click on the try to go to the log

This is done by parsing the HTML files and combining the information from the log files.

#### dps.report upload

Please use the dps.report upload with care and do not spam it with all logs that you have. 
It will upload multiple logs in parallel but is limited to 3 at the same time.

## Information for developers

### Generic endpoint upload

The generic endpoint is built against the REST API that my guild has, so it will not fit to all APIs.
Some information around that:

* The files are encrypted by a RijndaelManaged encryption before the upload and need to be decrypted by the receiver.
* The endpoint for upload is `<endpointUri from the config.json>/<raidGroup>/<date as dd.MM.yyyy>/<filename of the log>` and uses a `http put`. The file is in the `content`of the http request.
* After all files are uploaded  `<endpointUri from the config.json>/<raidGroup>/<date as dd.MM.yyyy>` will be called with `http post` (this triggers the timeline creation on our the server)

### raidTimeline.Logic.dll

Feel free to use the `raidTimeline.Logic.dll`, it provides an interface `ITimelineCreator` and the `TimelineCreator`.  
With these you can build your own tools if you want.
